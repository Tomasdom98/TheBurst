About:

Artificial Intelligence (ML) and optimization model to decentralize French companies from big cities.

Through a form, companies fill in information about their business:

Company information:

-Number of employees
-Budget
-Business sector
-Importance of having companies in the same sector in the location

Economic Environment:

-Maximum distance needed to the airport and the train
-Choice of suburbs

Quality of life:

-Importance of the quality of life of its employees.
-Importance of proximity to the sea or hills.

-Choice of uploading databases for a more accurate model or development of more variables.


Based on all the information and preferences put into the form the model recommends the 3 best cities or towns to place your main business. Within each recommendation, the following information is given for each location:

-Location
-Nearest airport an distance in km
-Nearest train station an distance in km
-Population of the place
-Average price per m2 in EUR
-Winner of the elections (political thought of the place)
-The 5 closest cities with the most similar preferences (Machine Learning Clustering)


Model
-Recommendation of the 3 best places to put your business.
-Machine learning clustering model to recommend 5 cities similar to the one recommended by the model to give more options to the user if he/she is not satisfied.

Benefits
-Reduction of all costs
-Better life and work conditions for employees
-Support local economies
-Proximity to industrial areas

The idea with my team, was to solve a fundamental problem occurring in France and all over the world, the centralization of companies in big cities. Through The burst, we had the commitment and desire to help companies through our model to find cities and towns that based on their preferences are the best to go to put their headquarter and get better costs, quality of life and opportunities.
